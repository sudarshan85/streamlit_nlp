# Basic NLP App using Streamlit

This is a project which uses [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) to deploy an NLP app that does basic NLP tasks. It was created based on a series of tutorial videos on Youtube by [Jesse E. Agbe](https://github.com/Jcharis/). All of his Streamlit tutorials can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ39kWiJXSixyRMcn3lrbv8xI8ZZoYNZU). 

The tasks that are implemented are:
1. Tokenization and Lemmatization (using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage))
2. Named Entity Recognition (using spaCy)
3. Sentiment Analysis (using [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/))
4. Text summarization (using [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/index.html) and  [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy))
